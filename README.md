# Doot-Switch
## A joke Unity multiplayer game created to entertain/annoy friends.

This is a personal project made as practice for using the Unity multiplayer system, as well as various miscellaneous game mechanics, UI elements, and menu interaction/navigation.

### How to install
Search through the [releases](https://github.com/Daecher/Doot-Switch/releases) page to find the most recent build of the game (labeled vX.Y.Z), and download the accompanying .zip file. All that's left to do is extract the contents of that .zip file into one location, and run the Unity executable inside.
